# How to run the application
Steps (commands):
1.  Download the source code into a folder and open a terminal into that folder.
2.  Once in that folder: `cd frontend` then `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies for the frontend.
3.  Once all the dependencies are installed, `npm start` to get the frontend started. The frontend will run on localhost:3000.
4.  Open a new terminal and go again in the root of the main project folder.
5.  `cd backend` then `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the backend.
6.  Once all the dependencies have been installed by npm, run `nodemon server` to get the backend fired up.
7.  After you start both the frontend and the backend, the application is ready on localhost:3000.
